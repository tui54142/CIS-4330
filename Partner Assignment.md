# What you think is going on with Docker vs the box that you installed it on (my pc)?
## Generally speaking, Docker is seperating the file system from my PC to the guest (container that was created). Additionally, it's seperating how much network, IO access, memory, as well as the interface for Docker to utilize for the application that it wants to run. During installation, I had to download Ubuntu (OS) but it ran through Docker. The only thing that my pc is doing is running the Kernal (Docker in this case) and providing the resources and it's unaware of the applications that Docker is running..
