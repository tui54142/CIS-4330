## Why do I want to do a case study on: Cloudflare Workers microservices
### I find it super fascinating that you can utilize a microservice architecture on something as small as HTMl and how you can swap out different JavaScript code without having to re-write code should you want to make a website responsive. I'm currently enrolled in classes that work with web applications and had completed a class on the client-side that worked with JavaScript. I really want to look into how much Cloudflare has extended in terms of JavaScript and if there would opportunities for the incorporation of other code (perhaps on the server-side).
