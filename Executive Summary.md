# API Gateway
The API gateway layer is an enterance to an environment that implements microservices. It's easier to put it to split up the gateway and the API to get a better understanding. The gateway brings in the requests of an external API. With the requests, the gateway is able to map them appropriately to the service implemenations which include microserives, miniserivces, and macroserivces. Additionally, the fateway ensures that there is loose coupling between the servicing the comsumer and the services that implement an API's functionality. The Gartner report mentions that when building/implementing a microserivce architecture that there are typically one-to-many relationship between the plusblished API as well as the set of microserivces that implement the API functionality. Typically an outer API exposes multiple functions and each function maps to a seperate microservice.

The reports goes into how the API gateways enforce deiation policies which include the following:
- Security that is relating to authentication, authorization, encryption of content, validation and verification, as well as others.
- Traffic management which consists of requesting routing, load balancing and throttling
- Monitioring which means to obserive, analize, and monetization
- And lastly, transformation that relates to versioning, multiexperience support and semantic reconciliation

There are some familiar uses to API gateway such as Google Apigee and Oracle API Gateway or as microgateways such as Kong and Tyk. All in all, API gateways can be implemented as centeralized control points.
