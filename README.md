## Assignment 1: Microservice Gartner Report Blog
#### I found it interesting that a microservce isn't reusable since you would think that a service provided is by default, reusable. At first I compared a microservce to something like a widgit since it wasn't a service that was relying on one particular program, but upon further reading I reconsidered that train of thought and would say that a microservice is multiple, scalable project that can be combined to bring functionality to an application but is also independently functional. Adding on, from the diagram "Multigrained Architecture", I found that you can have multiple data stores (implementing more resources) each with their own runtimes and all implementing seperate features that I assume could be swapped out at anytime without affecting the data manipulation allowing for flexability within itself. I came to the conclusion that there would be some instances where you would want to implement microservice (I'm thinking something like Google since there is google drive, google calender, etc.) but there are other times where you wouldn't want to use microservice (like a private family business). Not every business/application should have microservice, though I'm still trying to think of other examples of where microservices could be beneficial.
