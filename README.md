## Assignment 1: Microservice Gartner Report Blog
#### I found it interesting that a microservce isn't reusable since you would think that a service provided is by default, reusable. At first I compared a microservce to something like a widgit since it wasn't a service that was relying on one particular program, but upon further reading I reconsidered that train of thought and would say that a microservice is multiple, scalable project that can be  combined to bring functionality to an application but is also independently functional. Adding on, from the diagram "Multigrained Architecture", I found that you can have multiple data stores (implementing more resources) each with their own runtimes and all implementing seperate features that I assume could be swapped out at anytime without affecting the data manipulation allowing for flexability within itself.
